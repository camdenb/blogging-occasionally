Hey Camden (or person that is following me on Github)! Long time no see!

I've decided to post again to vent a bit about tomorrow: I'm meeting my Little for the first time! To be honest, I have no idea what to expect. Who's to say that the kid won't like me? What if he doesn't wanna talk to me? How do I know what to say to him if he brings up a difficult subject (home life, etc.)?

Then again, I've worked with kids in the past, if always in an academic context. I know how to deal with them in most situations, both positive and negative. That said, the goal was never just to make conversation, but rather to help them with homework or an arts and crafts project.

But hey, if anything the first meeting will be easier than the following ones: if there's a lull in the conversation I can always just ask him another question about himself. I wonder if FORD (family, occupation, recreation, dreams) will work when talking to a kid. I think F is off-limits, I suppose O is school, R is obvious, and D is actually a great thing to talk about with a child.

Whew, this post is very rambly. It's also an excuse to procrastinate on my philosophy paper, and my philosophy reading, and my discrete homework, and my fundies project, and my theology reading... eh, better than watching YouTube videos.
