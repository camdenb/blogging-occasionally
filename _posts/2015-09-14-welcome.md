title: today I made a blog
description: ...and boy are my arms tired!

Obligatory "first post!" It's 12:41am for me right now so I'm in no state to write a high-quality post. That said, don't expect too many high-quality posts from me even when I'm fully awake. But hey, that's half the fun of blogging: baring your soul to ~~your hundreds of loyal followers~~ Google's page-crawling bot.

That's all I got in me, one paragraph. (I'm shrugging in real-life but it's kinda hard to translate that to text)
